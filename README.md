# 🚀 Ansiversa App Starter

A clean starter template for building apps in the Ansiversa ecosystem using:

- `@ansiversa/components`
- Shared global design system
- Built-in layouts (WebLayout / AuthLayout)
- Tailwind CSS + Astro

## 🛠️ Setup

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start development:

```
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```
npm run build
```

## 🎨 Design System

All tokens & CSS come from:

```
@ansiversa/components/styles/global.css
```

Do not override global styles. All apps must remain visually consistent.
